My name is Quinn. I currently work as a Network Specialist at public school district part-time and attend Pennsylvania College of Technology as a full-time student, majoring in Network Administration and Engineering.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On this site, I post projects I work on both at home and at school. For the most part, I will include items from working in my home lab.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This site, built using the &lt;a class="link" href="https://gohugo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Hugo Static Site Generator&lt;/a>, is a fun little project I also took on as a part of my homelab, hosted on GitHub.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Â &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Please feel free to check out my socials, and to share the content!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
