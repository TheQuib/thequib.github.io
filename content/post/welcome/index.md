Welcome! My name is Quinn. I currently work as a Network Specialist at public school district part-time and attend Pennsylvania College of Technology as a full-time student, majoring in Network Administration and Engineering.

On this site, I post projects I work on both at home and at school. For the most part, I will include items from working in my home lab.

This site, built using the [Hugo Static Site Generator](https://gohugo.io), is a fun little project I also took on as a part of my homelab, hosted on GitHub.
