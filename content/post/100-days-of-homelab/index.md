## üìÜ The challenge!

If my calculations are correct, this extends out to September 20, 2022.

This challenge calls for 100 days of homelabbing from everyone! Dedicating at least 1 hour a day to learning something new, adding something, figuring something out... anything!

The official website can be found [here](https://100daysofhomelab.com)!


## üìù Keeping track üì±

 - This post is meant to keep track of my plans for the next 100 days. I will be adding and changing the different things I will be doing as I go, with a few starters for now.
 - I will also be posting to social media with all of my accomplishments for the day


## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap

With no particular dates or order, here's what I'm planning on accomplishing:

 - [ ] The constant improvement and documentation on this website (completed projects)
   - [ ] Fix Favicon not showing on every page except home
   - [ ] A self-hosted GitHub runner for pushing out this site
 - [ ] Creation of website as a subdomain for drone flying
 - [X] Custom Linux images on Proxmox with [Packer](https://www.packer.io/)
 - [ ] [Terraform](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/terraform) projects that create virtual machines from the previous Packer image
 - [ ] Getting to know the Cloudflare platform (and it's dashboard) a little better, and taking advantage of their free products
 - [ ] Making a good [and secure] mix between local and cloud-hosted services by use of cloudflare DNS under a single domain
 - [ ] SSH Key *everything*
 - [ ] Set up IPMI port on Proxmox host
