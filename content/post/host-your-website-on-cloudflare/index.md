## What is this?

[Cloudflare pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) is a web app hosting platform that hosts websites for free. It's free to anyone with a Cloudflare account, and super easy to set up!

I'll be using the Hugo static site generator. I have a full tutorial on how to get this set up and working in your own environment [here](https://quibtech.com/p/create-a-static-website/).


## üìù Requirements

 - A Cloudflare account
 - A GitHub account
 - GitHub desktop
 - An IDE to work in (such as Visual Studio Code)
 - Your static site files
   - Don't know where to get started? [I have a post on this](https://quibtech.com/p/create-a-static-website/)!

&nbsp;

## üîç Prepare GitHub

### üö© Create a repository

First, let's get started by creating the site's repository. This can be named whatever you want:
 - An example for me would be: `my-website`
 - Make sure this is set to `public`
 
 - You can initalize a README if you would like
 - If you're using *Jekyll*, it may be a good idea to initalize with a `.gitignore`


## üîΩ Clone the repository

Now, we'll get the repository down to the local machine to work on it. You can either do this in a GUI with [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) or by using the [Git CLI](https://git-scm.com/) with the following command:

```bash
cd directory/to/clone/to/
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/yourRepository
```

## Add necessary files

### üîº Open in your IDE

 - It's super easy to work with a git repository in an IDE, such as Visual Studio code. But your favorite IDE should work anyways.
 - Open up the directory you cloned your repository to


### ‚ûï Add site files

Get your hugo project files into this repository's directory (if you are using Hugo). Or again, other site generators will do just fine.

## ‚úÖ Commit

Now, let's get everything commited to GitHub.

- In *GitHub Desktop*, enter a message and click `Commit` on the bottom-left of the application
- In *Git CLI*, cd into your cloned directory and enter the following commands, substituting your own message if you would like:

```git
git commit -m "Add site files"
git push
```


## üîç Get cloudflare set up

 - Log into the cloudflare dashboard, and head over to the `Pages` tab:

 - Click `Create a Project` > `Connect to Git`

### üîó Link GitHub

 - Click `Add account` to link your GitHub account
 - Once linked, click the account dropdown, and select your account
 - Select the repository you created from the list that shows
 - Click `Begin setup`

### ‚öôÔ∏è Project Settings

If you would like, go ahead and make a few tweaks:

 - Name the project whatever you would like
   - Such as "My website"
 - Make sure "master" is set as the *Production branch*
 - Leave *Framework preset* set as none
   - If you are using anything other than Hugo, check out the dropdown to see if your framework is there!
 - Enter `hugo --minify` as the build command
 - Enter `public` as the *Build output directory*

### üë®‚Äçüíª Environment variables

In order to specify a Hugo version, we will need to configure an environment variable

You can find the latest Hugo version [here](https://gohugo.io/categories/releases)

 - Click the `Environment variables` link
 - Click the `Add variable` button
 - Use the following in the text boxes:
   - *Variable name*: `HUGO_VERSION`
   - *Value*: `0.98.0`
     - This is as of July 13, 2022. The latest version may be different for you
 - Click `Save and Deploy`


## ‚úÖ Watch the magic happen!

Now, you will see a terminal output, giving you the status of the deployment.

If it worked, it will present you with a URL for you to go to with your website!
